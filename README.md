!!! Presenting the inner workings of my meticulously crafted Stopwatch App, developed using Java and XML !!!

1Ô∏è‚É£ Start Functionality:
-Upon tapping the 'Start' button, the app initiates a timer using SystemClock.uptimeMillis().
-A dedicated handler, synchronized with the main thread, kicks off a continuous update mechanism through a dynamic Runnable.
-The Runnable calculates elapsed time, formats it, and updates the TextView seamlessly.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Stop Functionality:
-The 'Stop' button serves to pause the stopwatch, capturing the current state.
-Time elapsed is stored in variables, allowing for a smooth resumption when needed.
-The handler removes the callback, halting the continuous update until resumed.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Reset Functionality:
-'Reset' brings the stopwatch back to its initial state.
-All time-related variables and parameters are reset to zero, ensuring a clean slate.
-The TextView is updated to display '00:00:00,' ready for a fresh timing session.

üîÑ Continuous Update Mechanism:
-The heart of the stopwatch lies in a Runnable that continuously updates the display.
-Elapsed time is calculated by subtracting the start time from the current SystemClock uptime.
-Time is formatted in minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, providing a user-friendly display.

üåê UI and Material Design:
-The app embraces Google's Material Design principles, featuring MaterialButtons for an aesthetic touch.
-The TextView elegantly showcases the elapsed time, maintaining a clean and user-friendly interface.

‚öôÔ∏è Efficient Handling:
-Leveraging the power of Handlers and SystemClock for accurate and efficient timekeeping.
-Thoroughly tested for precision and reliability, ensuring a seamless user experience.
